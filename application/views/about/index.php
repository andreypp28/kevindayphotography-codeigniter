                    <p class="dropcap">Kevin Day was born in Hamilton, MA, where his career with photography began at the early age of 12, while playing around with his Dad&rsquo;s camera. His love and fascination with photography stayed with him all through high school, and led him to The New England School of Photography in Boston, MA where he graduated in 2002 with a major in Fashion Photography and a minor in color. Kevin specializes in model portfolios, fashion, weddings, children and head shots. He spends much of his time shooting models for New England&rsquo;s top agencies.</p>

                    <p>His easy going, friendly disposition makes him a great photographer for all ages. His ability to make people comfortable allows him to capture the true essence of their personality. Kevin shoots outdoors, on location and in the studio.</p>
